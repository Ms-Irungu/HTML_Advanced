# HTML_Advanced
In this and coming project, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file. For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic. 
This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:
